#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 Given a list of ingredients and a target profile
 returns the best allocation of ingredient quantities 
 so that the recipe matches the target profile
 while minimizing the price of the recipe.
 For now let's assume that a target profile consists in
 4 real values denoting respectively the number of calories,
 proteins, carbohydrates and fats to match.
 An ingredient has the 4 same attributes plus a price per unit.

** Deployment on AWS

In order to deploy the you endpoint simply run

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
serverless deploy
#+END_SRC


** Usage 

You can now invoke the Lambda directly and even see the resulting log via

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sls invoke -f opt -p mocks/opt-event.json 
#+END_SRC

The expected result should be similar to:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
< @todo >
#+END_SRC
